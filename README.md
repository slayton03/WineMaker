# WineMaker
### Introduction
Hello. My name is Stephen Layton and this is the repository for my WineMaker software. This was created for my ECE 1895 Junior Design class. This program was created in python using the customTKinter library for the GUI.

Please direct any questions to: stl82@pitt.edu

### Overview
This is a software for winemakers to track wines properties and track predicted schedule. This program will allow you to store different wines and the  information that goes along with them including name, tank number, volume(L), sugar, pH, stage, and SO2. Using this inputed information, the program can run various calculations such as potassium metabisulfite additions based on volume and desired SO2 ppm raised, yeast addition for fermentation, and basic unit conversions. Also, given a start date and an anticipated end date, the program will genrate a suggusted schedule to use including 1st racking, 2nd racking, bentonite addition, bentonite racking, rough filtration, sweetening, and final filtration. All data is stored in an excel sheet using the openpyxl library to create an excel file and store, adjust, and delete data in given cells. This is done so that users have easy access to all data in case of program errors.

Overall, this version of the program is similar to the original concept. I wanted to make a program that would keep track of wines and their proporties, run calculations, and generate a timeline based on a desired end date. The biggest difference this current version has from the original is in the orignal concept, I planned to have a section that keeps note on the staus of the vineyard and what is being done. This idea proved to be too big an addition given the time constraint but may be able to be implemented if future versions of this program are made.

As stated earlier, this program uses the customTKinter library and while that was incredibly useful for the GUI widgets, such as buttons and labels, all functionallity of this program was created from scratch. I choose to do this project because my parents own a winery and there aren't many good softwares for winemakers to keep track of their wines and wine properties so I decided to make this program for my dad to see if this would be helpful to him.

-Just add a dash first and then write a text.

-If you add another dash in the following line, you will have another item in the list.
    - If you add four spaces or use a tab key, you will create an indented list.
        - If you need sert an indenta list within an intended one, just press a tab key again.

Sometimes you want bullet points:

*Start a line with a star 
*Profit!

1. Just type a number follow by a dot.
2. If you want to add a second item, just type in another number followed by a dot.
1. If you make a mistake when typing numbers, fear not, Markdown will correct for you. 
    1. If you press a tab key or type four spaces, you will get an indented list and the numbering will start from scratch.
        1. If you want to insert an indented numbered list within an existing indented numbered one, just press the tab key again. 
            -If need be, you can also add an indented unordered list within an indented numbered one, by pressing a tab key and typing adash.
